## Sandwich Store

In a cafeteria, sandwiches can be ordered before 10:00 AM. A web application has been created so that students can do this via computer.

- [x] Each student must first register with the system. The subsequent login will be done with an email address and password.

- [x] However, the student cannot choose the password themselves. It is generated (4 characters, numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters possible), and sent via email after registration is complete.

- [x] The student must check their mailbox after registration to retrieve the password and log in.

- [x] Provide an option for the student to have a new password emailed to them if they forget the current one.

- [x] After logging in, they will see a list of sandwich types (small brown, large brown, small white, large white, ciabatta,...) from which they can choose.

- [x] This sandwich can then be topped (multiple types of toppings per sandwich are possible): ham, cheese, tomato, lettuce, butter, mayonnaise,... There is a fixed price per type of topping and type of sandwich.

- [x] Since the cafeteria needs to receive the order in time, ordering is only possible until 9:59 AM. From 10:00 AM onwards, you can only view what you have ordered that day.

- [x] (Only one order per day is possible, but of course, hungry students can include multiple sandwiches in a single order).

- [x] Logout option in the menu.
